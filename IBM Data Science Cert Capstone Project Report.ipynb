    "In this project we will try to find suitable neighborhoods for opening a **vegetarian restaurant** in **Toronto, Canada**. According to Happy Cow, Toronto is among the world's top 10 vegan-friendly cities in the word. Given the abundance of vegetarian/vegan options in the city, choosing a suitable location for opening a new venue becomes very important. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would want to find neighborhoods with:\n",
    "1. Low direct competition and that are not already crowded with vegan/vegetarian restaurants.\n",
    "2. High density of population under the aged of 35. According to a 2018 Dalhousie University study, 2 out of 3 vegans in Canada are either from generation Z or millennials, so this population group will be the target market.\n",
    "3. High expandable income.\n",
    "4. Near to farmer's markets to get fresh, flavorful produce at minimum cost. \n",
