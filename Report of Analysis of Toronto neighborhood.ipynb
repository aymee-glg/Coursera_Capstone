    "\n",
    "The first phase of our analysis consisted in collecting the data required, which came from multiple sources, and in preprocessing the data so it could be suitable for cluster analysis. The three main Python libraries that were used for data preprocessing were pandas, numpy and geopandas. \n",

    "\n",
    "The socio-economic data of interest was the total population density aged 15-54 and the average after-tax income of each neighborhood. These data was part of a larger dataset in CSV format, so many methods in the Pandas library such as slicing, renaming and NumPy methods such as replacing, rounding were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in order to get the total population density per square meter aged 15 to 54, the total population aged 15-24 and the total population aged 25-54 were added, and divided it by the land area of each neighborhodd in square meters. \n",

    "Having the coordinates of our location candidates, resquests were sent to the explore endpoint of the Foursquare API to get data on the vegan/vegetarian restaurants that are within a radius of 2.5 km of the center of each neighborhood. The Category ID corresponding to \"Vegetarian/Vegan restaurant\" was taken from Foursquare web site.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the neighborhoods vary in size of land areas, the radius was set big enough to make sure that all existing \"vegan/vegetarian\" restaurants in each neighborhood were returned, even for the biggest neighborhoods. However, this caused that requests associated to small neighborhoods returned restaurants that were located in adjacents neighborhoods. Out of 732 returned venues, only 110 venues had an unique ID.\n",

    "In order to remove all duplicates, it was needed to identify in which neighborhood each venue really belonged to. This was achieved by using the shapely package to test if the geographical coordinates of each venue, represented as a Point object, was inside (True) or outside (False) the boundaries of each neighborhood, represented as Polygon objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the Foursquare API returned 12 venues which primary categories were not \"Vegetarian/Vegan\" restaurants, which were further explore using the venue endpoint of the Foursquare API. These venues were vegan-friendly but not fully vegetarian/vegan venues. From those venues, proper restaurants were kept in the dataset, while those that are not proper restaurants such as bars, pubs, and coffe shops were removed since they are not considered direct competitors.\n",

These neighborhoods have low number of Vegetarian restaurants making competition easier than in other neighborhoods. They also count with high target population size.

Specifically, Church-Yonge Corridor is closed to the city center and could attract tourist looking for vegetarian/vegan options.\n",
